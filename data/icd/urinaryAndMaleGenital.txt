   ICD-O morphological coding: Introduction
   The ICD-O coding system uses a topography (T) code and a morphology (M) code together, but these are pre‐
   sented in separate lists for ease of use. Behaviour is coded /0 for benign tumours; /1 for unspecified, borderline,
   or uncertain behaviour; /2 for carcinoma in situ and grade III intraepithelial neoplasia; /3 for malignant tumours,
   primary site; and /6 for malignant tumours, metastatic site. Behaviour code /6 is not generally used by cancer reg‐
   istries. For various reasons, the ICD-O morphology terms may not always be identical to the entity names used in
   the WHO classification, but they should be sufficiently similar to avoid confusion. The designation “NOS” (“not
   otherwise specified”) is provided to make coding possible when subtypes exist but exact classification may not
   be possible in small biopsies or certain other scenarios. Therefore, it is usual to have “NOS” even when a more
   specific alternative term is listed in ICD-O.
